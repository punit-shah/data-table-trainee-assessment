data-table-trainee-assessment
=============================

This was a test designed to demonstrate my front end development skills.

The file `data.json` contains the monthly number of broadcasts per BBC channel for the year 2009.

For this test, I had to:

- write JavaScript code that uses the data from the JSON file to render a table in the body of the HTML document.
- write clean, semantic HTML.
- style the table with CSS to look neat and clear.

I had to do this with standard JavaScript. This meant I could not use a library or jQuery plugin to create the table for me. jQuery could still be used for DOM manipulation.

I also provided a visualisation of the data in the form of a line chart. The user is able to navigate between the table and the chart with tabs.
[Chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org/) was used to create the chart.
